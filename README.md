## The first part of test.

Questions:

Question: Explain a scenario where useReducer is more advantageous than useState.
Options:
A) When managing simple state variables.
B) When the next state depends on the previous one.
C) When managing state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on complex calculations.
D) All state management should be done with useReducer.

Answer: C (When managing state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on complex calculations)

Question: What is the main difference between Static Generation and Server-Side Rendering in Next.js?
Options:
A) Static Generation serves the same HTML to all users, while Server-Side Rendering can customize the HTML for each request.
B) There is no difference.
C) Static Generation is faster but less secure.
D) Server-side rendering does not allow for dynamic content.

Answer: A (Static Generation serves the same HTML to all users, while Server-Side Rendering can customize the HTML for each request)

## The second part of test.

Please identify, describe, and fix the issue in the following code:

Link on solution - [click](example)

## The third part of test

Interactive Coding Task.

Link on solution - [click](components/LiveSearch/)

First, uncomment one of the component in the app folder and page.tsx then you can run the command
I decide to write very simple tests

install dependency - npm install
start project - npm run:dev
test covered - npm run jest:cover
test start - npm run jest

## The fourth part of the test

Question:
First:

1)Modular Components:
Break down the application into modular components, such as product listings, cart, and checkout, to facilitate easier maintenance and updates.
Leverage React components and organize them based on features and functionality.

2)Pages and Routing:
Use Next.js's pages directory for each section of the e-commerce site.
Implement efficient routing to ensure a smooth user experience.

3)API Routes:
Utilize Next.js API routes for server-side logic, especially for handling transactions and managing user data securely.

4)Data Fetching:
Implement efficient data fetching mechanisms, considering factors like caching and server-side rendering (SSR) to enhance performance.
Leverage Next.js's data fetching methods for optimized data retrieval.

5)State Management:
Choose a state management solution like Redux or React Context API to manage global states across the application.
Ensure a centralized and predictable state management approach.

6)Scalability:
Design the architecture to scale horizontally by deploying components independently.
Consider microservices architecture for scalability, enabling individual services to evolve independently.

7)Performance Optimization:
Implement lazy loading for images and components to enhance initial page load times.
Optimize images and assets to reduce bandwidth usage.

8)Code Splitting:
Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to load only the necessary code for a particular page, improving load times.

9)Testing:
Implement a robust testing strategy, including unit tests and end-to-end tests, to maintain code quality and catch potential issues early.

Second:

Verify that the state is being updated correctly using the appropriate state-setting function
Use console logs or use breakpoints in the component to track the flow of state changes and render.
In functional components, review the dependency array in the useEffect hook to ensure it includes all relevant dependencies.
Refer to community forums, like Stack Overflow, to see if others have faced similar issues and if there are recommended solutions.
